As the population surpasses 45 million, coupled with influx of refugees, pressure on existing infrastructure is mounting, particularly in rural and peri-urban areas. The Uganda National Groundwater Development and Management Study has revealed that only 3% of Uganda’s usable groundwater is being utilized. Furthermore, just 13% of the population relies on groundwater for domestic use, and critical sectors such as agriculture and industry remain underserved. The study highlights high-yield, untapped aquifers—particularly in paleochannel and fluvial systems in various parts of the country as major opportunities.\n\nThis project aims to accelerate groundwater development and management to improve domestic water access, strengthen resilience to climate shocks, and promote socio-economic equity. It will identify and map productive aquifers, develop them as source of water for rural and municipal water supply, irrigation, industrial and other uses; rehabilitate and recommission abandoned boreholes; implement catchment-based recharge protection strategies, and build capacity at the local government level.\n\nExpected outcomes include expanded access to safe and reliable waters, improved functionality and sustainability of water supply infrastructure, enhanced groundwater monitoring systems, and stronger institutional frameworks for groundwater management.\n\nThe project aligns with Uganda’s Vision 2040, NDPIV, and multiple SDGs, and complements existing sector strategies. It represents a low-risk, high-return opportunity for climate-resilient public investment, and contributes to GAFA’s goal of increasing water access across the Horn of Africa through evidence-based, inclusive groundwater development.","Project type":"Not required at this stage","Water utilization category":"· Water for People\n· Water for Food \n· Water for Economy","Proposed financing structure":"Public financing (with potential for blended support)","Indicative investment ($ million)":"US$180,000,000","Estimated income ($ million, year)":null,"Other benefits (that can either be monetized or not)":"Climate resilience, reduced disease burden, time saved collecting water","Operating costs are identified":"No","Engaged and contacted financiers":"false","Risk assessment available":null,"Project business case available":"No","Proposed water source":"groundwater","Proposed water abstraction infrastructure, indicative":"Deep boreholes, storage tanks, solar pumps, water kiosks","Proposed surface water abstraction":"No","Proposed groundwater abstraction":"To be determined per site (average 36,500 m³/year m³/day/site)","Specific water quality requirements, if any":"Safe for domestic, industrial and small-scale agricultural use","Aquifer type":"Not required at this stage","Aquifer productivity":"Not required at this stage","Main likely environmental risks identified":"Low; potential localized degradation if improperly managed","Main likely social risks identified (e":"Inequitable allocation; conflict risk if coverage is uneven","Climate stressors and shocks":"Drought, rainfall variability, increasing demand","Exposure":"High population pressure, rapid urbanization","Vulnerability and coping capacity":"Moderate to high; weak infrastructure and institutional capacity in rural areas","Additional information":null,"Project code":"UGA-04","File name":"4 Uganda Unlocking Groundwater Potential for Inclusive Water Access in Uganda.docx","URL":"https://ircwash.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/Projects2022-23-E24.21UNICEFGAFAProjectpipelinedevelopment/EaZmybSnGoRFsvkpHiXyI-gBMfcc3scJFfW0h1D5JE5_Lw?e=iDVcbP","Latitude":1.3733,"Longitide":32.2903,"Remarks":"Whole country"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[32.2903,1.3733]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Title":"Enhancing Climate-Resilient Groundwater Access and Sustainable Ecosystem Management for Refugee Communities in the Albert Nile Catchment, Northern Uganda","Location (coordinates)":"Rhino camp (2.966°N 31.395°E), Imvepi- (3.2452°N 31.2841°E), Bidibidi (3.53°N 31.35°E), Palorinya (3.353°N 31.992°E)","Location: local administration unit":"Adjumani, Rhino Camp, Imvepi, Palorinya Bidi Bidi and Lobule Refugee settlements.","Location: local administration name":"Adjumani, Madi-Okollo, Terego, Obongi, Yumbe, Nebbi, Zombo, Pakwach and Koboko Districts","Country":"Uganda","Lead agency":"Ministry of Water and Environment,\nDirectorate of Water Resources Management, Upper Nile Water Management Zone","Contact name":"Dr. Callist Tindimugaya","Contact function":"Director, Directorate of Water Resources Management","Contact email":"callist_tindimugaya@yahoo.co.uk","Contact phone":"+256772521413","Partners":"UNICEF, OPM, Northern Umbrella of Water and Sanitation (NUWS)","Project description":"Albert Nile catchment hosts over 837,161 refugees from South Sudan and the DRC, settled in the Adjumani, Rhino Camp, Imvepi, Palorinya, Bidi Bidi and Lobule Refugee settlements.

The mean temperature during the year within the entire catchment is about 24°C.This catchment experiences high rates of evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration is expected to increase by about 7% in 2030 and 10% in 2040, with a resultant effect on runoff, groundwater recharge and dry season flows, increasing drought risks.

In 2040, the above-mentioned values will generally range between 15% and 30%, while they reach about 35% and 50% in the eastern portion of Aswa River basin.

As a result, residents are forced to get water from unprotected sources which are far from their homes. Besides, they also buy water frequently from illegal persons and incur additional cost. A survey was conducted on a wellsite that shows the available demand from the deep wells where less than 50% of the need.The survey has confirmed that the town water supply service could not cover the demand of it with present existing capacity and based on the survey only 30 to 40% of the community can get access to adequate water from the existing capacity through their own private taps.
