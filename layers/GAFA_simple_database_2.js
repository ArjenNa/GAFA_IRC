While national studies and catchment plans affirm the zone’s groundwater potential, unregulated abstraction risks aquifer depletion, water stress, and community conflict. This project proposes an integrated, resilience-focused response to safeguard groundwater resources while expanding access to safe water for vulnerable communities.\nThe project will enhance recharge through the piloting of Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) technologies—such as check dams, infiltration ponds, and recharge wells—in targeted catchments. Simultaneously, it will establish and expand groundwater monitoring networks to generate data critical for long-term water planning and abstraction control.\nA key component will be the development of groundwater-based water supply systems in areas most affected by industrial extraction, ensuring that local populations directly benefit from resource investments. This will be supported by the rehabilitation of degraded catchments to boost recharge capacity.\nThe project also fosters public–private collaboration, especially with the oil and gas sector, to promote Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)-linked water security and recharge co-investments. Policy dialogue and institutional capacity-building on MAR and groundwater governance will ensure sustainability and local ownership.\nExpected outcomes include increased safe water coverage, improved recharge and monitoring, reduced water-related conflict, and strengthened regulatory capacity.","Project type":"Not required at this stage","Water utilization category":"Water for Nature\nWater for Economy\nWater for People","Proposed financing structure":"PPP","Indicative investment ($ million)":null,"Estimated income ($ million, year)":"$40,000,000","Other benefits (that can either be monetized or not)":"Improved aquifer resilience, private sector engagement, improved data for long-term planning","Operating costs are identified":null,"Engaged and contacted financiers":null,"Risk assessment available":null,"Project business case available":null,"Proposed water source":"groundwater","Proposed water abstraction infrastructure, indicative":"Recharge structures (MAR), observation wells, community water points","Proposed surface water abstraction":null,"Proposed groundwater abstraction":"To be determined per site (average 36,500 m³/year m³/day/site)","Specific water quality requirements, if any":"Safe for domestic, industrial and small-scale agricultural use","Aquifer type":"Not required at this stage","Aquifer productivity":"Not required at this stage","  Main likely environmental risks identified":"Groundwater pollution from industrial or surface runoff","Main likely social risks identified (e":"Community-industry tension over water access","Climate stressors and shocks":"Drought, extraction pressure, climate variability","Exposure":"High—industry-heavy and climate-affected region","Vulnerability and coping capacity":"High;
